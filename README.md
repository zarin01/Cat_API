# Cat_API

In this project we are working with APIs and we first work with a "Hacker news" API to get new, after we were tasked to create our own app. Instead of using the code we created for the orignial rohject, i started from scratch. I created two component, one generates cat images when you click the botton and the other for the header.

#How To Run

To run this app you can create a react app and just add these files into the src, except for the app.js and the app.css you need to replace those with the files i have in this git hub. Then do npm start and it should run!

#API I used
